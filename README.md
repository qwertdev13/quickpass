# QuickPass: A truly simple, minimal password generator

Pretty much, self explanatory. A random password generator with minimal design. You can even compile it, if you want to and run it as a APP (.exe/.deb)

# Setup
Clone the REPO & Access its folder
```py
git clone https://github.com/qwertdev13/quickpass
cd quickpass # Asumming Installation was succesfull.
```
```py
python ./run.py

# or

python run.py
```

A Pop-up will be open, if it doesn't appear check the TASKBAR OR DOCK (Depending on your device), and then manually toggle the app.
